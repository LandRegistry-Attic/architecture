  <h2>The Architecture So Far</h2>

  <br>

  <p>
    The image to the right is an overview of what the Alpha team has built to date.
    For more detail about these services please visit the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/production">production</a> page.
  </p>

  <p>The flow through the services is as follows:</p>

  <p style="padding:10px">
    <i>
      A caseworker types in the details of a title using the casework-frontend.
      This creates a title in json format that is posted to the mint.
      The mint hashes and signs the title and posts it to the system of record.
      The system of record stores the title but also puts a copy of the title on to a queue.
      The feeder picks up the title from the queue and creates a public view of the title and posts it to the search-api.
      The search-api stores the public title in an elastic search server.
      The property-frontend gets and displays information from the search-api for a requested title.
    </i>
  </p>
